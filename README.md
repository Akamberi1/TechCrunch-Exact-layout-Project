TechCrunch-Project
Hello!

This is a project that was assigned for me to do, in order to engage practically the knowledge that i got from the markup languages (HTML and CSS).

This is just a demo, or i can say a copy of the original website TechCrunch, which is a very informative source for Technology (check it out!).

I am happy with the result and will continue improving it since it is on its primary stage.

Hope this was helpful in any way!
